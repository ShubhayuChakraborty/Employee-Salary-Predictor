# Employee Salary Predictor
Author:SHUBHAYU CHAKRABORTY
## Overview

This is a small Streamlit app to predict employee salary based on two features: `Years` (years of experience) and `Job Rate`.

The repository contains a trained scikit-learn linear regression model (`linearmodel.pkl`) and a Streamlit front-end (`app.py`) to interactively predict salaries.

## Files

- `app.py` — Streamlit application that loads `linearmodel.pkl` and exposes a small UI to enter features and get a salary prediction.
- `linearmodel.pkl` — Pickled scikit-learn `LinearRegression` model used by the app.
- `data.txt` — Pointer to the original dataset source.
- `Employees.xlsx` — (appears to be project data/extras).
- `Analysis_Modelling.ipynb` — Notebook with exploratory analysis / modelling notes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+ (tested with Python 3.10/3.11)
- `streamlit`
- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`
- `joblib`

Install quickly with:

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install streamlit scikit-learn numpy joblib pandas
```

## Run the app

From the project root (`c:\Users\shubh\Shubhayu-IBM`) run:

```powershell
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

Or:

```powershell
streamlit run app.py
```

## Model diagnostic (important)

While inspecting the shipped `linearmodel.pkl`, the model is a `LinearRegression` with the following attributes:

- Intercept: `26076.577339562606`
- Coefficients: `[-247.57714062, -209.49775575]`
- Feature order (model expects): `['Years', 'Job Rate']`

Because both coefficients are negative, the model decreases the predicted salary as `Years` or `Job Rate` increase. This explains the observed behavior in the app (for example, entering `1` year of experience may return ~25,867 and entering `10` years returns a lower value ~22,857).

Root causes to consider:

- The training data may be corrupted, inverted, or mis-specified (e.g., target column inverted or features encoded incorrectly).
- The sample size or outliers in the dataset may have produced a negative slope.

Suggested next steps:

1. Inspect the training data (the notebook and `Employees.xlsx`): verify the target column (salary) is correct and not inverted/scaled incorrectly.
2. Visualize salary vs years and salary vs job rate to confirm the expected positive correlation.
3. Retrain the model after cleaning data. A simple retraining script should:
   - Load the dataset
   - Clean/validate numeric columns
   - Fit a `LinearRegression` (or a regularized model) and save `linearmodel.pkl` via `joblib.dump`
4. Optionally constrain coefficients (if appropriate) or use a different model (tree-based) if the relationship is non-linear.

If you want, I can add a small `train_model.py` script to the repo that loads `Employees.xlsx` (or a CSV), cleans it, fits a new linear model, and writes a new `linearmodel.pkl`.

## Quick debugging snippet

Run this snippet to print model details from Python (helpful when debugging):

```python
import joblib
model = joblib.load('linearmodel.pkl')
print('Intercept:', model.intercept_)
print('Coefficients:', model.coef_)
print('Feature order:', getattr(model, 'feature_names_in_', None))
```

## Contact / Next steps

Tell me which you want next:

- `Inspect training data` — I will open `Employees.xlsx` / `Analysis_Modelling.ipynb` and suggest cleaning steps.
- `Retrain model` — I will add a `train_model.py` script and retrain using sensible defaults.
- `Run app` — I can run the Streamlit app locally and show you the debug output.
